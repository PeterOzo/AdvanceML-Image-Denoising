Background Theory
Sparse Coding for Image Denoising
Sparse coding is based on the principle that natural images can be efficiently represented using a small number of basis functions from an overcomplete dictionary. For image denoising, we assume that:

Clean images have sparse representations in appropriate dictionaries
Noise is not sparse and will be suppressed during sparse reconstruction
The 2D-DCT basis provides an effective dictionary for natural image patches

Mathematical Formulation
For each image patch y, we solve the LASSO optimization problem:
minimize ||y - Ψθ||² + λ||θ||₁
Where:

y: Vectorized image patch (144×1 for 12×12 patches)
Ψ: 2D-DCT dictionary matrix (144×196)
θ: Sparse coefficient vector
λ: Regularization parameter (alpha in implementation)
||·||₁: L1 norm promoting sparsity

Implementation Details
Step 1: Image Loading and Preprocessing
python# Load image from MATLAB .mat file format
data = scipy.io.loadmat('boats.mat')
blurred_image = data['boats']
Step 2: Patch Extraction

Patch size: 12×12 pixels
Sliding window approach: Overlapping patches for better reconstruction
Total patches extracted: 60,025 patches from the input image
Each patch is flattened to a 144-dimensional vector

Step 3: Dictionary Construction
The 2D-DCT dictionary is constructed using the Kronecker product:
python# Create 1D DCT basis
D = np.zeros((12, 14))
for i in range(14):
    for t in range(12):
        D[t, i] = np.cos(np.pi * i * t / 14)

# Normalize columns to unit norm
D = D / np.linalg.norm(D, axis=0)

# Create 2D dictionary via Kronecker product
Psi = kron(D, D)  # Shape: (144, 196)
Dictionary Properties:

Overcomplete: 196 atoms for 144-dimensional patches
Normalized: Each dictionary atom has unit L2 norm
Structured: Based on cosine basis functions

Step 4: Sparse Coding with LASSO
For each patch, we solve the LASSO problem using scikit-learn:
pythonlasso = Lasso(alpha=epsilon)
lasso.fit(Psi, patch)
theta = lasso.coef_
Step 5: Image Reconstruction

Reconstruct each patch: patch_reconstructed = Psi @ theta
Handle overlapping patches by averaging contributions
Normalize pixel values and convert back to uint8 format

Parameter Optimization
Regularization Parameter Analysis
The project includes comprehensive analysis of the LASSO regularization parameter (α):
Alpha ValuePSNR (dB)Behavior0.0014.754Overfitting: Minimal regularization, noise retained0.014.761Optimal: Best balance between fitting and sparsity0.14.760Good: Slight over-regularization0.5+4.760Underfitting: Excessive sparsity, detail loss
Key Findings

Low α values (< 0.01): Lead to overfitting, where the model fits to noise
Optimal α ≈ 0.01: Achieves best PSNR by balancing data fidelity and sparsity
High α values (> 0.1): Cause underfitting with over-aggressive sparsity
